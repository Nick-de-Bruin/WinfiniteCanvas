# Winfinite Canvas

An infinite canvas application for Windows. It allows you to drag on your desktop background, dragging every window around as if you were using an infinite canvas. Inspired by applications like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

## Compiling

Opening the project and compiling it with Visual Studio 2022 should work out of the box.

## Caveats

- Is not able to move some applications such as the Task Manager
- Might not work with background overlay applications like Wallpaper Engine
- Weird behavior with full-screen applications
